			// You may think we have violated the DRY principle (Don't Repeat 
			// Yourself) because we've defined these properties in 2 places. 
			// While that is partially true, we've done this for good reasons. 
			// When you use the same class both as the domain and presentation model
			// that class becomes bloated with too many responsibilities. This is
			// not an issue for a small app (like this ContactBook app). But as
			// the complexity of your application increases, throwing all these
			// properties and methods into the same class will end up with a big 
			// mess. So, it's better to have two separate models, one for presentation
			// one for domain. This improves separation of concerns in your application
			// but on the downside it comes with a cost: you have to repeat some of
			// the properteis and map them together. While these few lines of 
			// property assignment are not a major issue, if this still bothers
			// you, you can use a convention-based mapping library like AutoMapper.
